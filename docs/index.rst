mjlab is a lightweight, open-source framework for robot learning that
combines GPU-accelerated simulation with composable environments and minimal
setup friction. It adopts the manager-based API introduced by
`Isaac Lab <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab>`_, where users compose
modular building blocks for observations, rewards, and events, and pairs it
with `MuJoCo Warp <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp>`_ for
GPU-accelerated physics. The result is a framework installable with a single
command, requiring minimal dependencies, and providing direct access to
native `MuJoCo <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco>`_ data
structures.

**Key features:**

- **Composable environments:** users define observations, rewards,
  terminations, and other MDP terms as modular building blocks
- **Minimal dependencies:** single-command install via ``uv``, low startup
  latency
- **Direct MuJoCo data structures:** native ``MjModel``/``MjData`` access
  with no translation layers
- **PyTorch-native:** observations, rewards, and actions are PyTorch
  tensors backed by zero-copy GPU memory sharing

For more on the design decisions behind mjlab, see :doc:`source/motivation`.

mjlab would not exist without the excellent work of the Isaac Lab team, whose API design
and abstractions mjlab builds upon.

Thanks also to the MuJoCo Warp team — especially Erik Frey and Taylor Howell — for
answering our questions, giving helpful feedback, and implementing features based
on our requests countless times.
